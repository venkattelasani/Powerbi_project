# 🌦️ Telangana Weather Data Analysis (2021–2024) — Power BI Project

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes Telangana’s weather patterns between **2021 and 2024** using **Power BI**.  
The goal is to transform raw weather data into meaningful insights about **temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed** across different districts, seasons, and years.

---

## 🧩 Objective
To build a Power BI dashboard that provides:
- Yearly and seasonal weather trends  
- Regional comparisons (District & Mandal)  
- Insights on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall variations  

---

## 📊 Key Business Problem
Telangana has diverse climate conditions across its districts. Understanding weather behavior helps in:
- **Agricultural planning and crop management**  
- **Urban development and disaster preparedness**  
- **Identifying extreme conditions and climate change patterns**

**Challenge:** Combine multiple years of weather data, clean it, and visualize it in an interactive dashboard for insights.

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Collected yearly weather data for **2021–2024** (District and Mandal level).  
- Each file contained **daily readings** such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed.

---

### 2️⃣ Data Integration (Power Query)
- Imported all four yearly files into Power BI.  
- Used **Power Query → Append Queries** to combine them into a single dataset named `FactWeather`.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning and Validation
Ensured the dataset was consistent and reliable by handling missing or invalid values.

| Parameter | Issue Found | Cleaning Applied |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Rain (mm) | Null values | Replaced with 0 |
| Temperature (°C) | 0 or negative values (impossible for Telangana) | Replaced with null |
| Humidity (%) | 0 or negative values | Replaced with null |
| Wind Speed (Kmph) | Negative values | Replaced with null |

✅ **Result:** Clean and trustworthy dataset ready for transformation.

---

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering (DAX Calculations)

#### **A. Measures**
```DAX
Avg_Temp =
AVERAGEX(
    FactWeather,
    (FactWeather[Max Temp (°C)] + FactWeather[Min Temp (°C)]) / 2
)

Avg_Humidity =
AVERAGEX(
    FactWeather,
    (FactWeather[Max Humidity (%)] + FactWeather[Min Humidity (%)]) / 2
)

Avg_Windspeed =
AVERAGEX(
    FactWeather,
    (FactWeather[Max Wind Speed (Kmph)] + FactWeather[Min Wind Speed (Kmph)]) / 2
)
```

#### **B. Calculated Columns**
```DAX
diff_Humidity =
FactWeather[Max Humidity (%)] - FactWeather[Min Humidity (%)]

Mandal_Name =
IF(NOT ISERROR(VALUE([Mandal])), [District] & "_" & [Mandal], [Mandal])

Month_Name = FORMAT(FactWeather[Date], "mmmm")

Season =
IF(FactWeather[Month_Name] IN {"December", "January", "February"}, "Winter",
IF(FactWeather[Month_Name] IN {"March", "April", "May"}, "Spring",
IF(FactWeather[Month_Name] IN {"June", "July", "August"}, "Summer", "Autumn")))

Year = YEAR(FactWeather[Date])
```

---

### 5️⃣ Data Modeling
Created a single **Fact Table (`FactWeather`)** with all necessary fields for analysis:

| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| Date, Year, Month_Name, Season | Time dimensions |
| District, Mandal, Mandal_Name | Location dimensions |
| Avg_Temp, Avg_Humidity, Avg_Windspeed | Calculated measures |
| Rain (mm) | Daily rainfall |
| diff_Humidity, Max Temp, Min Temp | Derived insights |

✅ Optimized model for performance and easy filtering.

---

### 6️⃣ Visualization (Power BI Dashboard Design)

| Section | Description | Visualization Type |
|----------|--------------|--------------------|
| KPI Summary | Displays overall metrics | Cards (Avg Temp, Avg Humidity, Avg Wind Speed, Total Rainfall) |
| District Analysis | Compare metrics across districts | Bar / Column Chart |
| Seasonal Trend | Weather variation across seasons | Line / Area Chart |
| Yearly Comparison | Weather changes over years | Line Chart |
| Humidity & Temperature Relation | Relation between humidity and temperature | Scatter / Combo Chart |

**Filters (Slicers):**
- Year (2021–2024)  
- District  
- Season  

---

### 7️⃣ Insights Derived
- 🌧️ **Rainfall** peaks during **June–September (Monsoon Season)**.  
- 🌡️ **Highest temperatures** in **May**, especially in *Nalgonda* and *Mahabubnagar*.  
- 💨 **Wind speed** increases during summer months due to convection currents.  
- 💧 **Humidity** lowest in winter, highest in monsoon months.

---

## 🎯 Project Outcome
✅ Combined 4 years of Telangana weather data into one clean dataset  
✅ Removed anomalies and improved data quality  
✅ Created custom DAX measures and calculated columns  
✅ Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard  
✅ Derived actionable insights on seasonal and district-level climate patterns
